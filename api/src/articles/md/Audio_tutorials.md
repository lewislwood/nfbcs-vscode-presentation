# Audio Tutorials

Here are a few audio tutorials for Vs Code. I demonstrate and talke about these features.  I hope these help.
You can also find all of these @ [Vs Code Intro Screen- reader](https://lewislwood.github.io/vsCode-Intro-Screen-Reader/
) live website with a player built-in. The ones below you download and play with your own player. I intentionally kept this website simple and easy to keep focus on the Vs Code IDE.

* [Typical coding and navigating](https://raw.github.com/lewislwood/nfbcs-vscode-presentation/master/media/Typical_coding_and_navigating.mp3)
A typical session of coding using vsCode. Here I outline how I utilize the various techniques for shortcuts, navigation, and picklists to do my job. All this done using a screen reader.

I walk through a recent mod. I use multiple editing groups, multiple points in a single file. Use a basic search and an object/symbol search. Checking for errors. The typescript app is displaying a dialog modal and giving out screen reader help messages.

## Original Audio Tutorials

Below are my original recordings back around 2022 when Vs Code was young as far as accessibility goes. Accessible buffer is now called accessible viewer and alt + f2 invokes it from terminal, chat and other places. When I recorded I dod not do the class viewer and oversight on my part.

Create a snippet file in the workspace. Then create the initial snippet in the file for testing everything.

Once tested, copy the single input line snippet we created in the previous video.

Then we add outer quotes and commas, and verify test.

Next audio we will make it a multi-line snippet.

* [Pt 10c Snippet multi input block reusability demoed.mp](https://raw.github.com/lewislwood/nfbcs-vscode-presentation/master/media/Pt_10c_Snippet_multi_input_block_reusability_demoed.mp3)
I perform the final steps to convert the single line input into a multi line input snippet. I then demo it buy creating 2 snippet blocks with different prompts and colors and borders each.

Next video I will demonstrate how to create snippets in 2 ways and assign keys.

* [Pt 10d Snippets Inline Choices and variables assigning key](https://raw.github.com/lewislwood/nfbcs-vscode-presentation/master/media/Pt_10d_Snippets_Inline_Choices_and_variables_assigning_key.mp3)
Demo and show how I created a signature snippet with a stopping end point to fill in description.

Show a fun snippet assigned to a key where you choose from a choice list of languages.

I also assign signature snippet  to key that automatically imports any selected text when invoked by the hotkey. You can add more if desired from there.
