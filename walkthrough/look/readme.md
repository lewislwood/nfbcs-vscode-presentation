# Editing and Navigation in Vs Code IDE

The files in this folder are good simple files to practice and get a feel of how the ide handles these situations.
Learning these techniques and skills will greatly improve your development capabilities and capabilities.

* articles.js - Folding & Selecting text.
Code folding. (ctl + k, ctl + l)  folds code between matching braces or selected text. This makes moving and delting easy and precise.

More complex selecting is "Select to matching bracket command). You can use your control pallette  to find this command and activate it, or you can assign it a key.  I assigned Select to matching bracket (ctl + caps lock + "\") and Go to matching bracket (ctl + shift +"|").
My way to select the markdown section is as follows:
  1.) ctl+shift+| to go to closing matching brace., ctrl+caps+\ to select from closing brace to opening brace.3) Now press shift+down arrow and unselect the top 3 properties until I hear markdown: ` unselected.. 2. 4) Now simply paste replace text. 5) add back the `} in order to make it valid again.

  Down at bottom practice in the if blocks, inside each other.  Same technique .

* index.html
  Class viewer is the best way to navigate this file and it is large and complex. Ctl + "." will launch class viewer . Now navigate into the html. It is:
  html->body-> canvas ->outer-Header...

  You can also do ctl _+ shift + "o" to search for symbols (classes, id's, elements...)

  Either one press enter to go to the actual code. Now you can fold it and more...

  * mainGen.css - Class Viewer is the best way to navigate.

  * play.md
Here demonstrates using a markdown linter extension. Press ctrl + shift +  m to display the errors. Tab into an error and click on fix options. Now let it fix it for you.

Remember ctrl + "m" to turn on Tab or focus items. and ctl + shift + m will display errors and toggles back to code.
