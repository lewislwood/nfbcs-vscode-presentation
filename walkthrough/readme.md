# NFB CS V Code Walkthrough

This little folder is a water down project to review Vs Code IDE features.

* Index.js  
Review debug and variable inspection.  Also Launch files. Terminal, accessible viewer, hoover, watch window, hover peek, Java console, and more.

* Thunder-Client-Help.txt

Thunder Client Help output a handy reference while learning. This works in conjunction with the Thunder Client extension, must have $3/mo subscript or above.

* thunder-tests
 folder
 Contains a simple collection and API requests I created using the Thunder Client extension.
 Must modify ThunderClient settings under Settings to save to workspace. You can actually modify these files here and they will be reflected in the extension. Also  the extension suppors, environmental variables, iterations, delays, and concurrency.  Cobination with Testing the CLI creates rigorous testing.  It allows import and export to popular api testing tools.

* Look Folder
  Various files to demonstrate and practice editing via selection.

  ** articles
I demonstrate how to use folding to move folded code.
Select via matching brace, and then holding shift key and arrow down a few lines unselection the 1st parts of json properties. Replace the selected markdown with new markdown. Then simply add the closing "`}" fixing error.
Learning how to edit and move blocks reliable is a must for blind developers.

** index.html
This is a really involved html file. Use folding and class viewer to navigate to parts of the html file. This ability will allow you to reliable edit html without compromising the code.
 Also use symbol searching to find parts.

 ** mainGen.css
Css files are a pain to scan for class, id's, and element, and names

By viewing in class viewer you can quickly hear only the 1st lines of each css definition, thus reducing the noise. Each definition has numerous lines of properties and can be overwhelmeing when navigating.

** play.md
Here I demonstrate how handy a markdown lint extension can be. Simply do have the errors list offer up fixes and it will fix most automatically for you.
