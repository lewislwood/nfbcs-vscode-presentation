# NFB Cs Vs Code Presentation

This repository contains all the files I planned on presenting and more.
Goal is to aid visually impaired and blind  in using VS Code.

Blind and visually impaired have their own set of challenges.  Having a solid understanding and a footing, will help you to find and solve issues that you may encounter in the  Vs Code IDE.
